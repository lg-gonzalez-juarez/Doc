Tuples
Tuples are a fixed width, immutable sequence type. We create tuples using parenthesis (()) and at least one comma (,):</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>point = (2.0, 3.0)
Since tuples are immutable, we don’t have access to the same methods that we do on a list. We can use tuples in some operations like concatenation, but we can’t change the original tuple that we created:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>point_3d = point + (4.0,)
point_3d
(2.0, 3.0, 4.0)
One interesting characteristic of tuples is that we can unpack them into multiple variables at the same time:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>x, y, z = point_3d
x
2.0
y
3.0
z
4.0
When we’ll most likely to see tuples is while looking at a format string that’s compatible with Python 2 (though this will go away soon):</p>
