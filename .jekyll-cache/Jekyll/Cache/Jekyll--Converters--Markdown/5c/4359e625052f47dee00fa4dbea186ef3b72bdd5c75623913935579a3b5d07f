I"»<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>When writing scripts, we often want to leave ourselves notes or explanations. Python (along with most scripting languages) uses the # character to signify that the line should be ignored and not executed.</p>

<h3 id="single-line-comment">Single Line Comment</h3>
<p>We can comment out a whole line:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># This is a full line comment
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>or we can comment at the end of a line:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="c1"># This will add the numbers
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="what-about-block-comments">What About Block Comments?</h3>
<p>Python does not have the concept of block commenting that you may have encountered in other languages. Many people mistake a triple quoted string as being a comment, but it is not. Itâ€™s a multi-line string. That being said, multi-line strings can functionally work like comments, but they will still be allocated into memory.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"""
This is not a block comment,
but it will still work when you need
for some lines of code to not execute.
"""
</code></pre></div></div>
