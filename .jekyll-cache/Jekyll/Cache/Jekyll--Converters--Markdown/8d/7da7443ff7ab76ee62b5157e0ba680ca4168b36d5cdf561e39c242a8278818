<p>Hypertext is a way to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will. It provides a simple user-interface to large classes of information (reports, notes, data-bases, computer documentation and on-line help)</p>

<p>In this lesson we will look back at the history of the internet and the creation of the World Wide Web. We will see how the internet used to be a very dull and boring place filled with a lot of static web pages. This leads us to the reason that client-side scripting was implemented. Once we see where we came from, compared to where we are now, we can understand the need for JavaScript.</p>

<h4 id="the-challenge-of-dynamic-content">The challenge of dynamic content</h4>
<p>The problem was that the network speeds that were available made it difficult to load elements.</p>

<p>Photos and graphics were especially troublesome.</p>

<p>Page events such as mouse-over and on-click required the whole page to be reloaded.</p>

<p>This was slow and pages were not responsive.</p>

<p>Netscape navigator was the first browser to implement client-side scripting via the scheme script language. This would later become JavaScript. Others would follow, and eventually all modern browsers would support JavaScript as we know it today.</p>

<p>Javascript on the client allows just in time compilation of the code, to permit manipulation of the HTML elements in a page without requiring reloads of the full page.</p>
