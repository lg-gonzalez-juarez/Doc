<p>Being able to perform actions on a collection is incredibly useful in any type of programming, and it is pretty common to need to perform a single action on each item. We could do this by using a loop, but there are built-in collection functions that can take a collection and a function or lambda to run each item through. In this hands-on lab, we utilize higher-order functions to process some existing lists by using lambdas.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">map</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sorted</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reversed</code> functions are great examples of higher-order functions that can receive a function (or lambda) as an argument and do things accordingly. In this hands-on lab, we‚Äôre going to leverage these functions and lambdas to process some pre-created lists within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collection_processing.py</code> script.</p>
