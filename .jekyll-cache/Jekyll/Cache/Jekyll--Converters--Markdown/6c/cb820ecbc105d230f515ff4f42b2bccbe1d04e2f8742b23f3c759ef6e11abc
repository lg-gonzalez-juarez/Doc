<p>Perhaps this section should have been called “Misleading People with Charts”.</p>

<h3 id="rules-for-good-charting">Rules for Good Charting</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Title: Make the title meaningful to the chart and to what the chart shows.</li>
  <li>Axes: Make sure they do not distort the data.</li>
  <li>Axes Labels: Should indicate what they show by stating the units. For example, years or miles per hour.</li>
  <li>Legend: If the chart shows information for more than one data sequence, make sure a legend is provided that shows the differentiation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many of these seem like common sense, but representational mistakes can and do happen. Let’s look at some examples, as shown in the article by National Geographic, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/06/150619-data-points-five-ways-to-lie-with-charts/">“A Quick Guide to Spotting Graphics That Lie”</a>.</p>
