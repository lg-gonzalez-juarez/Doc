<p>Up to this point, all of the code that weâ€™ve written will always execute sequentially regardless of the inputs that we provide (assuming that we donâ€™t cause an error). In this lesson, weâ€™re going to learn about conditionals. Conditionals allow us to add branching logic to our code, and take different actions based on conditions.</p>

<h3 id="the-if-and-else-statements-1">The if and else Statements</h3>

<p>With a grasp on comparisons, we can now look at how to use conditionals to run different pieces of logic based on values. The main keywords for conditionals in Python are if and else. Conditionals are the first language feature weâ€™re using that require us to utilize whitespace to separate our code blocks. We will always use 4 spaces as indentation. The basic shape of an if statement is this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if CONDITION:
    print("CONDITION was True")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The CONDITION portion can be anything that evaluates to True or False, and if the value isnâ€™t explicitly a boolean then it will be implicitly converted to determine how to proceed past the conditional (essentially wrapping the CONDITION with the bool constructor):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; if True:
...     print("Was True")
...
Was True
&gt;&gt;&gt; if False:
...     print("Was True")
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To add an alternative code path, weâ€™ll use the else keyword, followed by a colon (:), and indent the code underneath:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; if False:
...     print("Was True")
... else:
...     print("Was False")
...
Was False
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="handling-multiple-cases-with-elif">Handling Multiple Cases with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elif</code></h2>

<p>Being able to perform one thing or another based on a condition is useful. But there are many situations where we want to check multiple possible conditions, and have more than two possible branches. In this lesson, weâ€™ll learn about how we can use the elif statement to have multiple branching paths in our conditionals.</p>

<h3 id="the-elif-statement">The elif Statement</h3>

<p>When we want our programs to have more than two possible outputs, then the elif statement will work perfectly for us. The elif statement looks a lot like the if statement:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">if CONDITION:
   # do something
elif CONDITION_2:
   # do a different thing
else:
   # do something if all conditions are False
</code></pre>

<p>We can chain as many elif statements together as we need, so the number of cases that we can handle is effectively limitless. Letâ€™s put elif to use by creating a script to evaluate the length of a name provided when we run the script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>learning-conditionals.py

name = input("What is your name? ")
if len(name) &gt;= 6:
   print("Your name is long.")
elif len(name) == 5:
   print("Your name is 5 characters.")
elif len(name) &gt;= 4:
   print("Your name is 4 or more characters.")
else:
   print("Your name is short.")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we run this, we can see the various results:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python3.7 learning-conditionals.py
What is your name? Keith
Your name is 5 characters.
$ python3.7 learning-conditionals.py
What is your name? Alex
Your name is 4 or more characters.
$ python3.7 learning-conditionals.py
What is your name? Alex
Your name is 4 or more characters.
$ python3.7 learning-conditionals.py
What is your name? Bob
Your name is short.
$ python3.7 learning-conditionals.py
What is your name? Cynthia
Your name is long.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that we fell into the first elif statementâ€™s block, and then the second elif block was never executed even though it was true. We can only exercise one branch in an if statement.</p>
