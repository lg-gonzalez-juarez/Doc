I"y<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>When writing scripts, we often want to leave ourselves notes or explanations. Python (along with most scripting languages) uses the # character to signify that the line should be ignored and not executed.</p>

<h3 id="single-line-comment">Single Line Comment</h3>
<p>We can comment out a whole line:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># This is a full line comment
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>or we can comment at the end of a line:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="c1"># This will add the numbers
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="what-about-block-comments">What About Block Comments?</h3>
<p>Python does not have the concept of block commenting that you may have encountered in other languages. Many people mistake a triple quoted string as being a comment, but it is not. It’s a multi-line string. That being said, multi-line strings can functionally work like comments, but they will still be allocated into memory.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"""
This is not a block comment,
but it will still work when you need
for some lines of code to not execute.
"""
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="variables-and-the-assignment-operator">Variables and the Assignment Operator</h2>

<p>Almost any script that we write will need to provide a way for us to hold onto information for use later on. That’s where variables come into play.</p>

<h3 id="working-with-variables">Working with Variables</h3>
<p>We can assign a value to a variable by using a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code> and we don’t need to (nor can we) specify the type of the variable.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_str = "This is a simple string"
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can print the value of that string by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my_var</code> later on:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; print(my_str)
This is a simple string
</code></pre>

<p>We can also change the value that is assigned to a variable later on, either by using the standard assignment operator = or by using some of the short-hand operators that we’ll learn about as we continue.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_str += " testing"
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_str
'This is a simple string testing'
</code></pre>

<p>An important thing to realize is that the contents of a variable can be changed and we don’t need to maintain the same type:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_str = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(my_str)
1
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally, we wouldn’t change the contents of a variable called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my_str</code> to be an interger, but it is something that Python will allow us do.</p>

<p>One last thing to remember is that, if we assign a variable with another variable, it will be assigned to the initial result of the variable and not whatever that variable points to later.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">&gt;&gt;&gt; my_str = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_int = my_str
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_str = "testing"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(my_int)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(my_str)
testing
</code></pre>

<h3 id="short-hand-assignment-operators">Short-Hand Assignment Operators</h3>

<p>There are numerous shorthand assignment operators we can use that allow us to perform operations and also assign back to variables in the way that we did with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+=</code> operator. The form for these shorthand assignment operations always follows the same pattern. We’ll take the operator that we want to use, say <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code>, and create a new operator by adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code> to the right-hand side of it. So, for the subtraction operation, we could subtract from the current value and assign the new value to a variable using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-=</code> operator.</p>

<p>As we learn about more and more operators we’ll be able to follow this pattern if we want to reassess our current variable based on an operation.</p>
