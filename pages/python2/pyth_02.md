# Using SciPy

## 22.1. Overview of SciPy

[SciPy](https://scipy.org/) is an ecosystem of Python, distinct and separately maintained packages for math, science, and engineering. This ecosystem is composed of:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): array package
- [SciPy library](https://scipy.org/scipylib/index.html): scientific computing package
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): 2-d plotting package
- [Ipython](https://ipython.org/): interactive console package, Jupyter Notebook
- [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html): symbolic math package
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): data structure and analysis package

In later lessons, will be demonstrating NumPy, matplotlib, and pandas. In this lesson, we are going to briefly look at the documentation for the SciPy library.

The SciPy library contains functions that make computation of higher-order math, science, and engineering calculations easier. However, these concepts are not the focus of this course, and we will not do more than become aware of the possibilities.
